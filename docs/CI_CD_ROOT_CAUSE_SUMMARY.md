# CI/CD Root Cause Analysis Summary

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Native Library Dependencies (Primary Issue)
**Root Cause**: The project depends on two native libraries that are not available in the CI environment:
- `libtokenizers.a` - Required by the `github.com/daulet/tokenizers` Go package
- `libonnxruntime.so` - Required by the `github.com/yalue/onnxruntime_go` package

**Impact**: 
- All tests involving ML packages fail during compilation
- Cross-platform builds fail when CGO is enabled
- Docker builds take excessive time trying to compile from source

**Evidence**:
```
ld: library 'tokenizers' not found
Error loading ONNX shared library "onnxruntime.so": dlopen(onnxruntime.so, 0x0001)
```

### 2. CGO Cross-Compilation Complexity
**Root Cause**: Building Go binaries with CGO enabled for multiple platforms requires:
- Target-specific C toolchains
- Platform-specific libraries
- Proper cross-compilation environment setup

**Impact**:
- Cannot build for Darwin/Windows from Linux CI runners with ML support
- Build matrix becomes complex with CGO dependencies

### 3. Missing CI Environment Setup
**Root Cause**: The CI workflow doesn't install required dependencies:
- No step to download/install tokenizers library
- No step to install ONNX Runtime
- CGO environment variables not properly configured

**Impact**:
- Tests fail immediately on import
- Cannot validate ML functionality in CI

### 4. Docker Build Strategy
**Root Cause**: Current Dockerfile attempts to build tokenizers from Rust source:
- Requires full Rust toolchain
- Compilation takes significant time
- May fail due to missing dependencies

**Impact**:
- Docker builds are slow and unreliable
- Increases CI/CD pipeline duration

## Issue Interconnections

1. **Library Availability** → **Test Failures** → **Build Failures**
   - Without libraries, tests can't compile
   - Without passing tests, builds are blocked
   - Without builds, releases can't be created

2. **CGO Requirements** → **Cross-Platform Complexity**
   - CGO requires platform-specific compilation
   - Each platform needs its own library versions
   - CI runners typically only support native compilation

3. **Docker Strategy** → **CI Duration** → **Development Velocity**
   - Building from source increases build time
   - Long CI runs slow down PR feedback
   - Developers wait longer for validation

## Critical Path to Resolution

1. **Install Libraries in CI** (Immediate)
   - Download pre-built tokenizers for Linux x64
   - Install ONNX Runtime from GitHub releases
   - Configure CGO environment variables

2. **Separate ML and Non-ML Builds** (Short-term)
   - Create build tags for ML features
   - Provide binaries with and without ML
   - Allow CI to pass without ML for non-Linux platforms

3. **Optimize Docker Builds** (Medium-term)
   - Use pre-built libraries instead of compilation
   - Create multi-platform base images
   - Implement proper build caching

4. **Improve Documentation** (Ongoing)
   - Document library requirements
   - Provide installation guides per platform
   - Create troubleshooting guide

## Success Metrics

- **CI Success Rate**: Should reach 100% for core functionality
- **Build Time**: Reduce Docker build from >10min to <5min
- **Platform Coverage**: Support Linux/macOS/Windows (with or without ML)
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain >80% coverage including ML components

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Action**: Apply the proposed CI workflow fixes to unblock development
2. **Architecture Review**: Consider making ML features a plugin or separate binary
3. **Dependency Management**: Vendor pre-built libraries for common platforms
4. **CI Strategy**: Use matrix builds with platform-specific configurations

## Lessons Learned

1. **Native Dependencies**: Projects with CGO dependencies need special CI consideration
2. **Cross-Platform Builds**: CGO makes cross-compilation significantly more complex
3. **Pre-built Binaries**: Using pre-built libraries is faster and more reliable than compilation
4. **Feature Flags**: Optional features should be built with tags to allow graceful degradation
